### README - MIE243 Mechanical Design Project: Planetary Gear Train / Cordless Screwdriver

#### Project Name: 
MIE243 â€“ Dissection 4: Planetary Gear Train and Cordless Screwdriver

#### Course Objectives:
This dissection builds on the skills learned in previous projects, further developing our understanding of mechanical assemblies, specifically **planetary gear trains**. We will:
1. **Model a planetary gear train** using SolidWorks, incorporating gears, housings, and other key components.
2. **Modify the design** by adding a locking mechanism that prevents rotation of the output shaft.
3. **Develop technical drawings** and explanations to aid in the assembly of the newly designed components.

### General Instructions:
1. **Collaborate and Document**: Ensure all team members participate equally in the design and CAD work. Document individual contributions for inclusion in your portfolio.
   
2. **Dissect the Cordless Screwdriver**: Disassemble the screwdriver to access its planetary gear train. Carefully measure and model the components of the gear train, and be mindful of the small parts to avoid loss.

3. **Planetary Gear Train Modeling**: Using SolidWorks, model each gear in the planetary gear train, including the sun gear, planet gears, ring gear, and planet carriers. The **housing** and other supporting components should also be modeled, but simplified as needed to avoid unnecessary complexity.

### Design Instructions:

This project focuses on two main tasks:

1. **CAD Model 1**:
   - Create a **SolidWorks model** of the complete planetary gear train, from the sun gear (attached to the motor) to the output shaft. 
   - Simplify where appropriate but ensure key features like gear teeth, dimensions, and gear spacing are accurate. If any measurements are missing, modify or approximate them for feasibility.

2. **CAD Model 2**:
   - Modify the gear train by adding a **locking mechanism** that can hold the output shaft stationary when the user presses a button. 
   - This mechanism should work similarly to a **shaft lock button**, commonly seen on rotary tools. 
   - Show the new **button** and the mechanism in your modified CAD file. The lock should prevent manual rotation of the shaft when pressed but not interfere with powered operation.

### Measurement Checklist:
- **Housing**: Measure and model the housing, including outer dimensions, thickness, and general geometry. Simplify surface features where necessary.
- **Sun Gear**: Measure the gear parameters and shaft diameter.
- **Planet Gears**: Record gear parameters.
- **Planet Carriers**: Measure the rough diameter and shaft locations, simplifying where possible.
- **Ring Gear**: Record the outer diameter and gear parameters.
- **Output Shaft**: Model the output shaft as a straight cylinder with no additional features.

For each gear, record the following:
- Pitch circle diameter or module
- Number of teeth
- Face width
- Shaft diameter
- Hub type/diameter (if applicable)

---

### Deliverables:

1. **CAD Model 1**:
   - A complete SolidWorks model of the **planetary gear train assembly**, based on the measurements you collected. Use the gear toolkit to model the gears as accurately as possible. Feel free to modify missing or conflicting dimensions to ensure a functional model.

2. **CAD Model 2**:
   - Start with CAD Model 1 and add a **locking mechanism**. The mechanism should prevent manual rotation of the output shaft when the button is pressed.
   - Submit both the **original** and **modified** CAD models.

3. **Mechanical Drawings**:
   - Include **2D mechanical drawings** of the modified portions of the mechanism (any parts added or modified). The number of drawings is left to your discretion but should be sufficient for a machinist to understand how to build and assemble the mechanism.
   - Omit unmodified components from the drawings for clarity.

4. **Question**:
   - Q1: Explain how the locking mechanism works and how it is assembled, referring to the drawings provided. Specifically:
     - a. Include 2D mechanical drawings of the modified portions.
     - b. Describe how the mechanism operates and how the parts are assembled, referencing the drawings.

### Conclusion:
This dissection challenges us to apply mechanical design principles by modeling a **planetary gear train** and developing a **locking mechanism** to modify the design. By measuring, modeling, and redesigning a real-world product, we continue to enhance our skills in both **CAD** and **mechanical systems analysis**.
